From reddit about "How would you describe what Jenkins is in simple":
-"It's just an automation tool for orchestrating workloads.

I wouldn't say 'it runs scripts at regualrly scheduled times' because that makes me think of cron. And you really can't compare jenkins to cron."

- "Jenkins is a self-contained, open source automation server which can be used to automate all sorts of tasks related to building, testing, and delivering or deploying software." 

Essentially, Jenkins is a tool to build, test, deliver and/or deploy software.
